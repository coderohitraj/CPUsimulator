# CPUsimulator
a basic cpu simulator
This repository contains a simple CPU simulator implemented in C. The simulator is designed to execute programs provided in binary format, along with corresponding data.

File:

processSimulator.c, which contains the code
program.txt, this file contains the binary representation of the program to be executed by the CPU simulator.
data.txt, this file contains the binary representation of the data needed for the program execution.

Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the processSimulator.c file using a C compiler.
Ensure that program.txt and data.txt files are in the same directory as the compiled executable.
Run the compiled executable, which will simulate the execution of the program using the provided data.
